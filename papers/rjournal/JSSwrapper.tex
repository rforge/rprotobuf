%% an abstract and keywords
\Abstract{
Modern data collection and analysis pipelines often involve
a sophisticated mix of applications written in general purpose and
specialized programming languages.  Protocol Buffers are a popular
method of serializing structured data between applications---while remaining
independent of programming languages or operating system.  The
\CRANpkg{RProtoBuf} package provides a complete interface to this
library.
