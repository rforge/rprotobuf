Dear author

Your submission 

  JSS 1313  

has just finished the pre-screening stage. 

As it does not meet all submission requirements of JSS, see
   http://www.jstatsoft.org/instructions
   http://www.jstatsoft.org/style
we currently cannot process it further.

In order to continue in the process there are a few changes that need to be
made. Attached in this email is a comments file where you can find all the
necessary changes.

Thank you for considering JSS and contributing to free statistical software.

Best regards,

Jan de Leeuw

For further instruction on JSS style requirements please see the JSS style
manual(in particular section 2.1 Style Checklist) at 
http://www.jstatsoft.org/downloads/JSSstyle.zip

Please see FAQ at: http://www.jstatsoft.org/style
And for further references please see RECENT JSS papers for detailed
documentation and examples. 

From the editorial team:

o Not all software mentioned is actually cited. Please correct this. 

o Also the replication materials could be 
made more accessible.


Manuscript:

o \section, \subsection, etc. in sentence style
o Annotations of figures/tables (including captions) should be in sentence style (*include period at end of caption).
o Do not use additional formatting for specific words unless explicitly required by the JSS style guide, e.g., 
o All table row/column headers should also be in sentence style.

o For R-related manuscripts: The first argument of data() and library() should always be quoted, e.g., library("foo").
o The code presented in the manuscript should not contain comments within the verbatim code. Instead the comments should be made in the normal LaTeX text.
o In all cases, code input/output must fit within the normal text width of the manuscript.  Thus, code input should have appropriate line breaks and code output should preferably be generated with a suitable width (or otherwise edited).

o As a reminder, please make sure that:
  - \proglang, \pkg and \code have been used for highlighting throughout
the paper (including titles and references), except where explicitly escaped.

References:
o Springer-Verlag (not: Springer)
o Please make sure that all Software packages are \cite{}'d properly.
o All references should be in title style. See FAQ <http://www.jstatsoft.org/style#faq>.
