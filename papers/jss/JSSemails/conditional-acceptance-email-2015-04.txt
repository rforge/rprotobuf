Dear author,

Your submission

  JSS 1313

is conditionally accepted for publication in JSS. 

Your manuscript has just finished the post-processing stage. In order to
continue in the process there are a few changes that need to be made. Attached
to this email is a comments file where you can find all the necessary changes.

For further questions please see FAQ at http://www.jstatsoft.org/style.


Please send the full sources for your submission to the technical editor (
editor@jstatsoft.org). It should contain:


 1. The full sources of the latest version of the software. (Binary versions
    can be provided in addition.)
 2. The .tex, .bib, and all graphics for the manuscript: where the names of
    your files should be - your .tex file should be called jssxxx.tex and your
    .bib file should be called jssxxx.bib. As well as a complied .pdf version
    of your manuscript.
 3. Information on how to replicate the examples in the manuscript. (Typically,
    this is a self-contained standalone script file that loads/calls/sources
    the software package from (1). If data or other external files are needed,
    that are not yet provided with the software package, include these as
    well.) Please use subdirectories for Figures/ and Code/
 4. Please wrap all these files into a single .zip (or .tar.gz) file.
 5. Please make sure the .zip files only contains the necessary files. That is,
    please do not include .aux, .log, etc. files and any unused files such
    as jss.cls, jss.bst, jsslogo.jpg, etc.


Note for R authors: If you have prepared your manuscript using Sweave, the
files in (2) can be produced by Sweave, those in (3) by Stangle (possibly
enhancing the comments). Also indicate in your e-mail that Sweave was used and
the technical editor will provide you with further Sweave-specific information.
