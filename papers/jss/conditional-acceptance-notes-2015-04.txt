    2.1 Style checklist
  
    A quick check for the most important aspects of the JSS style is given
    below. Authors should make sure that all of them are addressed in the ﬁnal
    version. More details can be found in the remainder of this manual.
    • The manuscript can be compiled by pdfLATEX.
    • \proglang, \pkg and \code have been used for highlighting throughout the paper
      (including titles and references), except where explicitly escaped.
    • References are provided in a .bib BibTEX database and included in the text by \cite,
      \citep, \citet, etc.
    • Titles and headers are formatted properly:
      – \title in title style,
      – \section etc. in sentence style,
      – all titles in the BibTEX ﬁle in title style.
    • Figures, tables and equations are marked with a \label and referred to by \ref, e.g.,
      “Figure~\ref{...}”.
    • Software packages are \cite{}d properly.

From the editorial team:

o From one reviewer: As far as I can see there's only one difference between
the two columns of Table 3. It would be nice to highlight this.

  ## DEdd: Done, added a sentence below table and tightened wording in that
  Table note.


Manuscript style comments:

o Code should have enough spaces to facilitate reading.  Please include spaces before and after operators and after commas (unless spaces have syntactical meaning).

  ## DEdd: No change, we were good already

o The table in Figure 2 should have row/column labels in sentence
style. (Only the first word of a label should be capitalized).

  ## DEdd: Done (not sure I like it better)

o In all cases, code input/output must fit within the normal text width of the manuscript.  Thus, code input should have appropriate line breaks and code output should preferably be generated with a suitable width (or otherwise edited). E.g., see p. 9.

  ## DEdd: Replaces the Sweave code with its latex output and manually broke the long line
 
o For bullet lists/itemized lists please use either a comma, semi-colon, or period at the end of each item.

  ## DEdd: Done; one small change

o As a reminder, please make sure that:
	- \proglang, \pkg and \code have been used for highlighting throughout the paper (including titles and references), except where explicitly escaped.


References:

o John Wiley & Sons (not: Wiley, John Wiley & Sons Inc.)

  ## DEdd We only had one 'Wiley' where I removed a stray ".com"

o As a reminder,
	- Please make sure that all software packages are \cite{}'d properly.

	- All references should be in title style.

	- See FAQ for specific reference instructions.

  ## DEdd Update bibliography to current version numbers, and title styled

Code:

o As a reminder, please make sure that the files needed to replicate all code/examples within the manuscript are included in a standalone replication script.
