The RProtoBuf code base is a mix of many coding styles regarding
indentation, spaces, braces, and more.

Murray proposes running the whole code base through

 clang-format -style="{BasedOnStyle: google, IndentWidth: 4}" -i *.cpp

There are a number of other parameters that can be set however, see the full output of

 clang-format -dump-config

One changes have been made locally, you can view the diff with whitespace omitted with :

 svn diff -x -w

This will still pull up all the changes where lines were broken at 80
characters or braces changed lines, but will ignore most of the pure
whitespace changes for reviewing purposes before submitting.

After the code base has been converted with clang-format, the emacs
metadata comments at the top of each file will need to be updated as
well.
