Notes on Coding Style (C++ only for now).

1. Conventions: spacing, column limit, etc.
2. clang-format
3. excluded files
4. Emacs FoldingMode annotations.


1. Conventions: spacing, column limit, etc.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In December 2013 a pass was made through the code base with
clang-format to enforce consistency among several competing styles
that were used in the code base.  The new style requires:

1) 4-space indents
2) 100-character column limit
3) no indentation for top level objects inside 'namespace {'
4) no space inside opening/closing parenthesis of argument lists '(arg1, arg2)'
5) space before open brackets.
6) open brackets on same line as if conditional or switch statement.

These conventions can be changed, so long as the code base remains consistent.

2. clang-format
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These conventions can automatically be applied to files with:

 clang-format -style="{BasedOnStyle: google, IndentWidth: 4, ColumnLimit: 100}" -i *.cpp

There are a number of other parameters that can be set however, see the full output of

 clang-format -dump-config

One changes have been made locally, you can view the diff with whitespace omitted with :

 svn diff -x -w

This will still pull up all the changes where lines were broken at 100
characters or braces changed lines, but will ignore most of the pure
whitespace changes for reviewing purposes before submitting.

3. excluded files
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We exclude sisocks.h from style issues as it is written separately by
Simon Urbanek.

We exclude mutators.cpp and extractors.cpp temporarily as many other
changes were made to those files recently and we want to allow more
review before obfuscating the content changes with whitespace changes.

We exclude Rcppsupport.h and RcppMacros.h because I don't like the
result.  I want BEGIN_RCPP on its own line, for example.

4. Emacs FoldingMode annotations.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some of the files include '{{{' '}}}' annotations in comments that are
used to fold/unfold sections of code with Emacs folding mode (M-x
folding-mode).  You can then right click to expand/hide these sections
to get a higher level view of the file or drill down into specific
sections of the code.
